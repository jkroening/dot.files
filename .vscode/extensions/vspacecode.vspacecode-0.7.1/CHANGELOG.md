## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.1] - 2020-07-20
### Fixed
- Fixed README format

## [0.7.0] - 2020-07-20
### Changed
- Change `<spc> f f` to use `bodil.file-browser`

### Added
- ⌨️ Add `ctrl+h/l` to traverse `bodil.file-browser` menu

### Fixed
- Fix typo and grammar in default binding names

## [0.6.0] - 2020-07-16
### Added
- Add `<spc> <tab>` to switch to last editor
- Add <code>&lt;spc&gt; p `</code> to switch active project window (application window)
- Add support to run VSpaceCode locally with VSCode Remote
- Add `<spc> s S` to fuzzy search with selection
- ⚙️ Add `vim.useSystemClipboard` to the setting configuration command
- ⌨️ Add `<spc>` to trigger which-key menu when the active editor group is empty
- ⌨️ Add `ctrl+j/k` as a shortcut to traverse items in:
    + Quick open menu/QuickPick
    + Suggestion overlay/intellisense
    + Parameter hint (i.e. the overlay when there's multiple overloads)

    > If you bind `ctrl+h/j/k/l` for window navigation, you can add the `!inQuickOpen && !suggestWidgetVisible && !parameterHintsVisible` to the `when` section of those keybindings. See [README](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpacecode/blob/master/./README.md) the example of the bindings

### Changed
- Change `<spc> s s` to search the selection automatically if there's one

## [0.5.0] - 2020-06-29
### Added
- Add menu for magit ref `y` in normal mode
  
    This requires configuration of your `keybindings.json`, checkout the installation section of [README](https://github.com/VSpaceCode/VSpacecode/blob/master/./README.md) for more information

- Add configuration commands for setting up both `settings.json` and `keybindings.json`
- Add `<spc> b H/J/K/L` for directional editor moving
- Add `<spc> q` for Quit menu
- Add `<spc> j` for Jump/Joing/Split menu (#53)

  This requires `vim.easymotion` to be `true` in your `settings.json`

### Changed
- Split the core menu logic to another extension (`vscode-which-key`) so this extension can be focused on Vim users
- Change `<spc> s s` to use fuzzy search to emulate Helm Swoop/Ivy Swiper (#56)

### Fixed
- Fix the duplicated `<spc> f l` by move locate file to `<spc> f L`

### Removed
- Remove support of non-vscodevim users.

  If you are a non-vscodevim, please use `vscode-which-key` instead.

- Remove continuos config checker on launch

- Remove Gitlens bindings from the `<spc> g`

  To restore the previous `<spc> g` menu, merge the following overrides to `settings.json`

## [0.4.0] - 2020-06-21
### Added
- Implement transient menu
- Add `<spc> z` for zoom menu
- Add `<spc> 1...8` to focus different editor groups
- Add `<spc> b` for buffers/editors menu
- Add `<spc> e` for errors menu
- Add `<spc> v` for smart selection
- Add `<spc> *` to search with input
- Add `<spc> !` to show terminal
- Add `<spc> i` for insert menu
- Add `<spc> s` for search/symbol menu
- Add `<spc> p` for project menu
- Implement `args` key in the bindings to executes command(s) with args
For example, the follow the binding will map `y` in the menu to `y y` in vim to yank a line by passing a `args` for that command.
```jsonc
{
    "key": "y",
    "name": "Yank a line",
    "type": "command",
    "command": "vim.remap",
    "args": {
      "after": ["y", "y"]
    }
},
```
In this example: Only the second command has args. When `args` is used with `commands`, the `args` is expected to be an array. If the `null` is not present in the follow example, the first command (`formatDocument`) will receive the second element of `args` instead.
```jsonc
{
    "key": "=",
    "name": "Yank a line",
    "type": "commands",
    "commands": ["editor.action.formatDocument", "vim.remap"],
    "args": [
      null,
      { "after": ["y", "y"]}
    ]
},
```
